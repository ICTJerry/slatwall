#Intro
________________________

__Slatwall__ is an extremely powerful and robust digital commerce management system. It is designed to work in a multitude of different business situations, and helps to centralize your commerce activity by integrating into existing systems. Slatwall easily operates as an eCommerce shopping cart for your website but it can also do a lot more like Inventory Mangement, Vendor Ordering, Subscription Management, etc.

These docs should provide all of the information you need to get up and running with Slatwall. Broken up into two sections, the first helps developers get slatwall up and running, and the second focuses on users, the admin, and how to use it.

Its important to note that these docs are part of the Slatwall core which means they get updated as new versions of Slatwall are rolled out. The most current version of the docs can always be found at [getslatwall](http://docs.getslatwall.com), but your version spefic docs can be found in the slatwall admin under Help / Tools > Docs.

If you have a question that cant be answered by these docs you can post it to the google group (link in the top navigation above) where the community provides free support. In addition, ten24 offers professional support, maintenance agreements, and professional services for __Slatwall__. More information about these contracts can be obtained by contacting [ten24].
